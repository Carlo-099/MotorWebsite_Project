                <h2>What are Cafe Racers?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cafe racers are a style of motorcycles that originated in the 1960s in the UK. These bikes are known for
                    their minimalist design, low-slung handlebars, and a streamlined, vintage look. Cafe racers were popularized
                    by riders who modified their motorcycles for improved speed and handling, often racing between cafes.

                <h2>History & Culture</h2>
                <p>
                    The cafe racer culture is deeply rooted in the rebellious spirit of the 1960s. Riders would customize their
                    motorcycles for better speed and maneuverability, then gather at cafes to showcase their bikes and engage in
                    impromptu races. Today, cafe racers remain an iconic symbol of style, freedom, and the joy of riding.
